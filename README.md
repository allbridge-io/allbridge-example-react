# Allbridge Core SDK Example Project

This repository provides a simple example of how to integrate the Allbridge Core SDK into a React application. It demonstrates the essential functionalities of the SDK, including retrieving supported networks and tokens, calculating fees, estimating received amounts, and sending transactions.

## Project Structure

- **`src/pages/Demo.tsx`**: This component contains the minimal implementation of the core features of the Allbridge SDK.
- **`src/services/sdk.ts`**: This service aggregates all the methods used in the `Demo` component for interacting with the Allbridge SDK.

## Features

1. **Retrieving Networks and Tokens**: Fetches the list of networks and tokens that are available for transfers.
2. **Fetching Fees**: Retrieves the fees associated with a transaction.
3. **Calculating Received Amount**: Estimates the amount the recipient will receive after deducting the fees.
4. **Sending Transactions**: Initiates the transfer of tokens between networks.

### Note

This example project intentionally omits any form of validation or error handling for the sake of simplicity. Integrators are expected to implement these as per their specific requirements.
